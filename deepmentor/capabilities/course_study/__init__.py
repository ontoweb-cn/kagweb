"""Course Study loop capability and constants.

``CourseStudyCapability`` (the composer mode) is deliberately NOT re-exported.
It imports the agentic chat pipeline, which imports the loop/tool registries;
re-exporting it here would close the same interpreter-start cycle documented by
``deepmentor.capabilities.reading``. The mode is lazy-loaded from its class-path
string in ``runtime.bootstrap.builtin_capabilities``.
